In this article, we will show you how to install and use the Flysky Fs Ct6b driver and software on Windows 10.
 
## Step 1: Download the driver and software
 
You can download the driver and software from the official Flysky website: [https://www.flysky-cn.com/ct6b-xiazai-1](https://www.flysky-cn.com/ct6b-xiazai-1) [^1^]. The file name is CT6B-DOWNLOADS.zip and it contains two folders: Drivers & Instructions and T6config.
 
Extract the zip file to a location of your choice on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Install the driver
 
Before you connect the transmitter to your computer, you need to install the driver first. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Drivers & Instructions folder and double-click on CP210xVCPInstaller\_x64.exe if you have a 64-bit system or CP210xVCPInstaller\_x86.exe if you have a 32-bit system.
2. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
3. Restart your computer if prompted.

## Step 3: Connect the transmitter to your computer
 
After installing the driver, you can connect the transmitter to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the transmitter is turned off before you plug it in. Follow these steps:

2. Plug the other end of the USB cable into an available USB port on your computer.
3. Turn on the transmitter by sliding the power switch on the front of the transmitter.
4. Your computer should recognize the transmitter as a new device and assign it a COM port number. You can check this by opening Device Manager and expanding Ports (COM & LPT). You should see something like Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COMx), where x is the COM port number assigned to your transmitter.
